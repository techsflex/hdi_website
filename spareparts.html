									  <h5>Honda Genuine Engine Oil</h5>
									  <p class="mx-auto p-2 text-justify">Engine oil is lifeblood of your car’s engine. That’s why Honda takes countless steps to blend and test our exclusive Genuine Engine Oils for maximum performance of vehicle and engine. Civic, city and BR-V using the Honda Genuine Engine Oil intended for your specific model means that you’ll receive maximum fuel economy and engine performance — something the aftermarket motor oils at independent shops simply can’t provide.</p>
									  <p class="mx-auto p-2 text-justify">Using Non-genuine Engine oil will reduce life-span of your engine and cause internal engine damage, and probably, boost-up the maintenance costs of your vehicle.</p>

									  <h5>Honda Genuine Oil Filters</h5>
									  <p class="mx-auto p-2 text-justify">Oil filter helps remove contaminants, soot particles, and other undesirable dirt from a car engine’s oil that can accumulate over time, as the oil keeps your engine clean.</p>
									  <p class="mx-auto p-2 text-justify">Genuine Oil filters (exclusively provided at Honda Drive-In workshop and other authorized Honda dealership) will keep your engine oil clean: and ultimately, improve the overall performance. They’re also uniquely equipped with an anti-drainback valve that reduces wear and tear on your engine. Whilst, Non-Genuine oil filters definitely cannot offer same benefits, and are not designed to work as well  keeping contaminants out of your engine: meaning you might need to replace your engine oil more often or could be doing damage to your engine’s internal parts.</p>

									  <h5>Honda Genuine Air filters</h5>
									  <p class="mx-auto p-2 text-justify">Engines, like people, need to breathe clean air to stay fit. Without a free flow of clean air, an engine can't perform at its best.</p>
									  <p class="mx-auto p-2 text-justify">It's the job of an engine's air filter to remove dust and contaminants from incoming air before they could severely effect performance, increase fuel consumption and causes premature engine wear. As these pollutants build up on the filter, engine airflow becomes restricted, which adversely affects performance. That’s why it’s important to regularly replace your old, dirty air filter with a new Honda Genuine air filter. While, non-genuine air filters probably lead the contaminants enter into the engine and reduce performance.</p>

									  <h5>Brake Fluids</h5>
									  <p class="mx-auto p-2 text-justify">Honda Genuine Brake Fluid is specifically designed to work Honda braking systems and ease the clutch applications. They’re used to transfer force into pressure and to amplify braking force.</p>
									  <p class="mx-auto p-2 text-justify"> Imitation brake fluids are not: meaning, that your Honda braking system may not work at peak performance – especially over the long term.  You may have to replace your brakes and braking components more often if you don’t use Honda Genuine Brake Fluid. With greater safety and a lower cost of ownership, Honda Genuine Brake Fluid helps protect your passengers and wallet in a way that imitation brake fluid does not.</p>

				  <p>Over time, fluids lose essential protective properties, and waiting too long between changes can lead to mechanical damage and costly repairs. Honda Genuine Motor Oil, Antifreeze/Coolant, Brake Fluid, Automatic Transmission Fluid and Power Steering Fluid are specially formulated to protect your Honda’s mechanical components from harmful deposits, rust, corrosion and oxidation.
